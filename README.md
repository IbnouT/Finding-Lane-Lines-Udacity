# Finding-Lane-Lines-Udacity
Finding lane lines on the road - Project1 for Self-Driving Cars Nanodegree @Udacity
---

## Overview
This project provides an implementation of lane lines identification on the road using an image processing pipeline.

This is my first project submission as part of Self-driving cars Nanodegree @Udacity.

The main entry points :
- [P1.ipynb](./P1.ipynb) : Jupyter notebook with full step by step implementation of the pipeline and testing on images & videos.

- [writeup.md](./writeup.md) : Writeup describing the pipeline and explaining the solution approach, as well as some reflection of what might not work well and some improvement ideas.
